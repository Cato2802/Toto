# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression - Data Analysis & Residual Analysis in Python.
In this project, I utilized Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and StatsModels to predict house prices. I performed linear regression, data analysis, and residual analysis to gain insights into the data and evaluate the model's performance.
